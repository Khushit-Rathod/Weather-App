This is a small python code to display the temperature of a city on a particular date.
The user will enter a city and a date(YYYY-MM-DD format) after which the code will display the temperature of the city on that day.
I have used an API called oikolabs which already has data of the temperatures of all cities.
You can check it here :- https://docs.oikolab.com/#2-weather-data-weather
You need to generate your own API key. For that you need to sigup on oikolabs. After generating the API key replace the existing key with your key.
